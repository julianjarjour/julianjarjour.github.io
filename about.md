# hello!
<span class="dc">M</span>y name is Julian Jarjour. I'm a seventeen year old living in the Greater Boston area and I love to learn. I'm especially fascinated by the environment, both natural and built, and I'm pursuing a career in urban planning. Aside from that, jazz piano and photography are my main schticks.

I'll mainly be writing about botany, ecopsychology, urbanism, environmental justice, and philosophy.
## Colophon
<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the airâ€”to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>
I was staring blankly out the window some August morning when the motivation happened to strike, as it does, to build a website. My brother [Toni](https://www.tonijarjour.com/){:target="_blank"} always told me to make one, but I had never given it much consideration. Not knowing a lick of HTML or CSS, I threw myself into the process of learning-by-doing. Many missed sunsets later and you're here.
### Design
This is a static site hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} and generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, serving simple HTML and CSS files written in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/){:target="_blank"} on Arch Linux. I wanted this to be simple, cozy, and [sustainable](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/){:target="_blank"}. Part of keeping web emissions low is transferring less data to visitors. I managed this by using a serif [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/){:target="_blank"} as opposed to loading custom fonts, creating ASCII art for aesthetics without loading images, and doing without front-end JavaScript to save computing power.
