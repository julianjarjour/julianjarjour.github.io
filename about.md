<h1>as of 2/15/23</h1>
<span class="dc">I</span>'ve just come home from a week-long trip at Wood's Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. I learned lots of molecular biology and genetics, but the biggest effect it had on me was the formation of new habits. I had never gone on morning runs or eaten such filling, delicious meals thrice a day.

As a result, I'm undertaking the [C25K](https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/){:target="_blank"} plan and trying to cook and vary my meals more.
<h1>who am i?</h1>
<span class="dc">M</span>y name is Julian Jarjour. I'm a seventeen year old living in Greater Boston suburbia and I love to live and learn, in the true sense of the words. My curiosity has led me to study and partake in all of the things that I continue to wake for each morning.

<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the airâ€”to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>
