# hello!
<span class="dc">W</span>elcome to my website. I'm an 18-year-old student discovering the world from the purlieus of Lynn, Massachusetts.

I'm interested in the ways that our built environments affect our relationships with each other and with the natural world. The capacity for community is based on infrastructure, and the current trajectory in that regard seems to be separation. I want to help turn things around.

That entails, in part, connecting with nature myself. A goal of mine is to become self-sufficient, at least to the extent of turning fabric into clothing, lye into soap, and seeds into sustenance. I've otherwise been making an amateur botanist of myself and learning about horticulture along the way.
## The Website
This website started on an impulse, probably subconsciously fueled by the suggestions of my brother [Toni](https://www.tonijarjour.com/){:target="_blank"}. I taught myself HTML and CSS and began sculpting all of this by hand. Many missed sunsets later, and you're here reading it.

It's hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} and generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. I wanted this to be simple, cozy, and [sustainable](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/){:target="_blank"}. It turns out that websites have [carbon footprints](https://www.websitecarbon.com/){:target="_blank"}, and part of keeping emissions low is transferring less data to visitors. To that end, I use a [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/){:target="_blank"} as opposed to custom fonts, ASCII art for some lightweight decoration, and zero JavaScript.

The current page transfers just (x) kB. You can check this for any page by opening Inspect and navigating to the Network tab, then performing a hard refresh (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R`) and finding the number of bytes transferred at the bottom. Less is better.
