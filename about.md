# hello!
<span class="dc">M</span>y name is Julian Jarjour. I'm a seventeen year old living in the Greater Boston area and I love to learn. I've been primarily focused on piano and photography for many years, but am now finding myself captivated by the environment, both natural and built.

I've been exploring the natural environment through botany, natural history, reading the transcendentalists, walking through the woods, and looking up. I feel at peace in nature, even if the political tension surrounding it is not peaceful at all. I plan to write about ecology, conservation, and environmental politics to equip myself and others against the transient anthropocentric considerations creating that tension.

The built environment is where I spend most of my time and where my career interests lie. Where we live impacts every facet of our existence, including health, opportunities, communities, and even our sense of time, place, and being. Unfortunately, most places are lacking in those respects. I hope to not only be on the advocacy and education side of the push for sustainable, walkable, and livable cities, but also the policy and planning side of things. That's why I'm looking to study urban planning after high school.

## Colophon
<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the airâ€”to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>
I was staring blankly out the window some August morning when the motivation spontaneously struck, as motivation does, to build a website. My brother [Toni](https://www.tonijarjour.com/){:target="_blank"} had always been telling me to make one, but I never considered it until then. Not knowing a lick of HTML or CSS, I threw myself into the process of learning-by-doing. Many missed sunsets later, the site before you came to fruition.
