# hello!
<span class="dc">I</span> am a seventeen-year-old student discovering the world from the purlieus of Lynn, Massachusetts. My background is in photography and music, but more than anything I love nature and I love cities; I hope to aid a better synthesis of the two.

This website is my little nook amidst the internet's vast landscape, home to my thoughts and creations. You might find writing on any of my too many interests: botany, urbanism, ecopsychology, philosophy, and so on. I'm always learning about my local flora and fauna and gradually taking up homesteading in pursuit of self-sufficiency and kinship with nature.

### artistic appetite
Though trained in jazz piano, I much prefer playing the guitar because my lack of familiarity with it allows me to explore music anew, guided by the sound rather than the shapes imbibed in my fingers. I've explored the world through music; from Midwest emo to Syrian reggae to Indonesian gamelan—I performed in a youth Ewe drumming ensemble for a time—, but wherever I go, I bring jazz and folk with me.

I'm still figuring out my taste in film, but my favorite directors are Park Chan-Wook, Gakuryu Ishii, Wes Anderson, and Hayao Miyazaki. I like films that [speak with silence](https://boxd.it/nmkb6){:target="_blank"}; films where the mood is allowed to linger in the air, not felt *for* the viewer but *by* the viewer. As for books, I read mostly nature writing and other bits of nonfiction very slowly. I also enjoy philosophical fiction and poetry. Rachel Carson, Henry David Thoreau, and Sylvia Plath are some of my current favorite authors.
### pastimes
Tennis is my sport of choice. I'm a tenderfoot, having never seriously played a sport before, but after two weeks of obsessive practice I managed to secure a spot on my high school varsity team. It's a load of fun.

I used to spend most of my time on videogames, namely Rocket League. My favorite is probably Fistful of Frags. I've since completely switched to board games; Chess, Shogi, Go, and my favorite: Scrabble.
## Colophon
<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>
I was staring blankly out the window on a fall morning in 2023 when the motivation happened to strike, as it does, to build a website. My brother [Toni](https://www.tonijarjour.com/){:target="_blank"} always suggested I make one, but I never gave it much consideration. Not knowing a lick of HTML or CSS, I finally dove into the process of learning-by-doing. Many missed sunsets later and you're here.

### design devices
This is a static site hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} and generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, serving just HTML and CSS files handwritten in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/){:target="_blank"} on Arch Linux.

I wanted this to be simple, cozy, and [sustainable](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/){:target="_blank"}. Websites [do have carbon footprints](https://www.websitecarbon.com/){:target="_blank"}, and part of keeping emissions low is transferring less data to visitors. To this end, I used a serif [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/){:target="_blank"} as opposed to loading custom fonts, decorative ASCII art instead of loading images, and zero front-end JavaScript.
