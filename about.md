<h1>now</h1><span class="subtitle">02/15/23</span>
I've just come home from a week-long trip to Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory. I learned about DNA sequencing and molecular genetics, which gave me a newfound appreciation for plant life.

The biggest effect it had on me was the formation of new habits. I had never gone on morning runs or eaten such delicious meals thrice a day until this trip, and it felt so jarring to come back home to none of that. As a result, I'm undertaking the [C25K](https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/){:target="_blank"} plan and slowly but surely learning to cook.
<h1>who am i?</h1>
<span class="dc">M</span>y name is Julian Jarjour. I'm a seventeen year old living in Greater Boston suburbia and I love to learn. My curiosity has always led me by the hand like an eager child to some of the greatest adventures of my life—and often away from my worldly responsibilities.

<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>

I began with music and photography, both around 2018. I joined a youth jazz ensemble, signed up for piano lessons, and fiddled with my hand-me-down Canon 550D camera that I haven't upgraded to this day.
