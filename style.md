# This is a title header
<p class="postdate">January 32nd, 3000</p>

<blockquote class="epigraph">
Here is an epigraph. I pretty much never use these, but maybe I should.
</blockquote><figcaption>Julian Jarjour</figcaption>

<span class="dc">H</span>eres a paragraph of long enough length to prevent the dropcap from leaking into the elements below. Generally these will only be in the first paragraph of the post, but I suppose I could also use them after <h2> elements.

## second header

<div class="notice">This is a notice, in case I have disclaimers?</div>

Here's a shorter paragraph.

<blockquote>
Here is a blockquote. I am padding it with length because blockquotes probably aren't going to be one or two lines long, but I can't whip up more than three.
</blockquote>
<figcaption>Julian Jarjour</figcaption>

Here's a paragraph after the blockquote.

<p class="subtitle">This is a subtitle.</p>
<hr>
Here is a <a href="/asgsgadgajdg">unvisited link</a>.

Here is a <a href="">visited link</a>.

This underlined text has descenders: <u>Quajayagapa</u>.

## Capitalized Header 2
Text immediately following the header.

Here is an ordered list.
1. This item is long enough to spill over into a second line, which is indented.
2. This item is short.
3. This item is a apart from the other two. I wonder if I should fix this.

And here is some <code>inline_code</code> followed by a codeblock:

<pre>pre {
    overflow: auto;
    padding: 0.5em;
    line-height: 130%;
  }</pre>

And another list, but this time with spacing between the items. I wonder if I should fix that.

1. Wow!

2. No kidding!

3. These items are so far apart!

Here is a paragraph with <b>generic bold</b>, as well as <strong>important text</strong>. We've also got some <i>generic italics</i> and <em>emphatic stress</em>.

Here is some <small>small text</small>.

Here are some subscript<sub>1</sub> and superscript<sup>2</sup> numbers.
