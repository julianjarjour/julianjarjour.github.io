title: formative crash

It was the end of a quite long-winded dress rehearsal at Berklee when I engaged in one of my daily nonchoices. I ordered a rideshare home.

Half an hour later, I was shaking at the foot of the Lynnway Liquors billboard that adorned the side of its eponymous six-lane stroad, toiling to breathe as I listened to my mother speaking with an EMT. Framed against a pug-faced white car in the fluorescent-lit night, five words of their chat still ring in my head:

"Oh, it's his first time?"

Every year, six million crashes and tens of thousands of fatalities are reduced to background noise. We see traffic accidents as inevitable byproducts of getting around. It's now expected that everyone will have their "first time," as if to lose their car-crash virginity, and continue to get in accidents every so often. The magnitude of our car-dependency problem struck me as the seatbelt did my chest.

I still played my show the next day wearing borrowed sunglasses---mine were towed away. Despite my persistence to perform, the crash was perhaps what finally pushed me to pursue urban planning instead of music.
