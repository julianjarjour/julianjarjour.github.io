<span class="dc">S</span>even months have passed since my last article. In that time I graduated from high school, committed to college, learned to crochet, got a job, and regularly made tweaks to this website, but despite my attempts I never wrote a second article.

## I must be an expert
Regardless of the topic, every one of my writing session is preceded by very long bouts of research. To some extent, it helps the quality of my writing, but to this extent it reveals a lack of respect for my own thinking. I can't let my own thoughts, feelings, or opinions stand without some reputable confirmation.
