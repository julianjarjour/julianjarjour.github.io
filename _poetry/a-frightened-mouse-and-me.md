title: a frightened mouse and me

i starve myself tonight i do;
upon my midnight quest for food
climbing down the dim lit stairs
reached the kitchen, well i fared

but just as fate would fumble me
i switch the light on, shocked to see:
a table mouse who scurried fast
with every stomp i weakly cast

here and there and right this way
she ran and looked and rain away
the table's edge had had her stumped
and panicked she just had to jump

thump! though you might have missed
vanished she and very quick
the woes today did weigh on me
and so i let my stomach be
