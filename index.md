<figure><blockquote class="epigraph poem">My heart leaps up when I behold
    A rainbow in the sky:
So was it when my life began;
So is it now I am a man;
So be it when I shall grow old,
    Or let me die!
The Child is father of the Man;
And I could wish my days to be
Bound each to each by natural piety.</blockquote><figcaption>William Wordsworth</figcaption></figure>
