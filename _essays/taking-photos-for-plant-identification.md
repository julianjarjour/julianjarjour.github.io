<span class="dc">L</span>ately I've been diving into botany for fun, making my first confident plant identifications just yesterday: *Helianthus tuberosus* and *Silene latifolia*. It's exciting to finally have certainty in what I was observing. The thought that I might be able to recognize these flowers in the future, as if they're new friends, is even more exciting.

I don't carry a Flora around, so I have to take lots of photos of the plants I want to identify. I had no idea what to include in those photos for some time, so I'd end up back at home looking through *Flora Novae Angliae* with no recollection of whether the plant's leaves were opposite or alternating. The key to taking the right photos is knowing what to look for, i.e., the stuff that will be on your dichotomous key.

1. You'll need a photo of the face of the flower. Specifically, you need to be able to see the **androecium**, **gynoecium**, and **petals**. If the flower is imperfect, try to get pictures of the separate carpellate and staminate flowers.
2. Get a photo of the underside of the flower. This will give you a good view of the **calyx or involucral bracts**. You'll also be able to tell if the supporting stem is pubescent, scabrous, glaucous, and so on. It's okay if you don't know what any of those terms mean yet, but having the photo will help you learn once you sit down with a key.
3. Take one of the **inflorescence**. If there are multiple flowers on one plant, you're looking at an inflorescence. The term describes the arrangement of flowers on the plant, and with this photo you'll be able to determine if you're looking at an umbel or a corymb or a raceme. Again, don't worry about the terminology for now.
4. **Leaves**. The petioles, leaf structure, arrangement, venation, and shape will help narrow things down. Take one of the top and bottom of the leaf.
5. Finally, take a photo of the **entire plant**. With this you'll be able to see the distribution of leaves along the stem, and you can always zoom in to catch any details that were missing from the other images.

This may not always be enough, especially when dealing with more nuanced genera or families like Asteraceae. Regardless, it's a good minimum to roll with. Whenever I'm really unsure, I like to upload photos to iNaturalist or Google's image search to narrow a plant down to the genus. If you do this, I suggest working backwards from that genus in the dichotomous key to learn about its features. This way, you'll be able to identify it without relying on reverse image searching in the future.
