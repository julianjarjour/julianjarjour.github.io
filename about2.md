# Hello!
<span class="dc">M</span>y name is Julian Jarjour. I'm a seventeen year old living in the Greater Boston area and I love to learn. Though I've been primarily focused on piano and photography for many years, I now find myself captivated by the environment, both natural and built.

I've been exploring the natural environment through botany, natural history, reading the transcendentalists, walking through the woods, and looking up. I feel at peace in nature, even if the political tension surrounding it is far from peaceful. Through discussing ecology, conservation, and environmental politics, I hope to equip myself and others against the transient anthropocentric considerations creating that tension.

The built environment is where I spend most of my time. The areas in which we live impact every facet of our lives, including health, opportunities, and communities. Even our sense of time, place, and being is affected. Unfortunately, most places are lacking in these respects. I hope to not only be on the advocacy and education side of the push for sustainable, walkable, and livable cities, but also the policy and planning side of things.

*In my free time I love to play and write on the guitar, read poetry and nonfiction, watch strange indie films, play Scrabble, and listen to lots and lots of albums. A general endeavor of mine is to work towards self-sufficiency; I want to sew my own clothes, make my own soap, do my own woodworking, bind my own books, and manage my own finances.*
## Colophon
<figure><blockquote class="epigraph">Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory bells, and a fragrance filling the air—to a higher life than we fell asleep from.</blockquote><figcaption>Henry David Thoreau, <em>Walden</em></figcaption></figure>
I was staring blankly out the window some August morning when the motivation spontaneously struck, as motivation does, to build a website. My brother [Toni](https://www.tonijarjour.com/){:target="_blank"} had always been telling me to make one, but I never considered it until then. Not knowing a lick of HTML or CSS, I threw myself into the process of learning-by-doing. Many missed sunsets later and you're here.
### Design
This is a static site hosted through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} and generated with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, serving simple HTML and CSS files written in [Neovim](https://neovim.io/){:target="_blank"} on Arch Linux. I wanted this to be simple, cozy, and [sustainable](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/){:target="_blank"}. Part of keeping web emissions low is transferring less data to visitors, and I work towards that by using a serif [system font stack](https://systemfontstack.com/){:target="_blank"} as opposed to loading custom fonts; creating ASCII art for visual interest without loading images; and doing without front-end JavaScript to save computing power.
### Inspiration
Much of my time working on this was actually spent exploring the small web and bookmarking all of the sites I enjoyed. A few of them heavily inspired me either through the content or the design.
