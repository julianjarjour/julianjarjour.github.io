      <h1>My First QGIS Project</h1>
      <p class="postdate">August 9th, 2024</p>
      <p><span class="dc">A</span>s a very early headstart on my minor in Geospatial Imaging and Analysis, I’ve made my first foray into GIS using the free and open-source <a href="https://www.qgis.org/" target="_blank">QGIS</a> to visualize the number of car crashes within 250 meters of schools in Lynn.</p>

<p>I began by skimming through Matt Forrest’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SovdBaus7pM" target="_blank">wonderful tutorial</a> and then picked up some school and crash data from <a href="https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massgis-bureau-of-geographic-information" target="_blank">MassGIS</a>. The map doesn’t really say anything, especially given that nearly none of the crashes involve pedestrians under 20 years old, but it was a good primer for me nonetheless.</p>

<figure class="bigimg"><img src="assets/schoolcrashmap.jpg" width="864" height="610.983" /></figure>

<p>I overlooked the fact that the red spots are overlapping, making them seem darker than they are. Hopefully I can make some more beautiful (and functional) maps moving foward. But for now, I’m happy with what I’ve created. Not so happy with the file size.</p>
