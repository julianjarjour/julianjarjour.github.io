<span class="dc">T</span>en days ago, I surprised my girlfriend with a pendant that I wire wrapped for her birthday. She makes lovely jewelry herself, and has made several pieces for me in the past. Unbeknownst to her, I became organically interested in the craft in the past month and decided to learn wire wrapping so I could make her something for once.

It's my first piece of jewelry, and I'm overjoyed that she loved it! What's more is that I've never been much of a gifter, but crafting this from the choice of stone to the wax seal stamp has made me realize that I love gift-giving. Here's a bit of my process.

First, I ordered the choicest bloodstone cabochon (a shaped and polished stone) off of Etsy. Bloodstone is one of the March birthstones, along with aquamarine. As an aside, it irks me that birthstones are largely a marketing ploy by the gem industry. I wish I could find more reliable sources for their historical bases. Bloodstone is beautiful nonetheless. Anyway, I also ordered a 5mm faceted (cut) citrine gem to match the hints of yellow in the bloodstone. 

I bought the last coils of 20g and 26g copper wire from Michaels' ransacked shelves, raided my dad's basement workshop for some wire cutters and pliers, and got to following [a great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLAEE0fHpE) from Ellie's Handcrafted Jewelry.

Being my first time wire wrapping, I struggled to get my base wires straight and couldn't keep Goldilocks tension on the weaving wire. You can see the unevenness of my first weaves in the picture above. This persisted for most of the project, but I did a nice job of keeping everything even when I got to the back, pictured below. Visible improvement from the beginning to the end of the piece.

I don't think the wires I bought were quite "dead-soft," as is recommended for wire wrapping, so that may have made things more difficult. The gauges were perhaps too similar, making the piece clunkier than it could've been. It also would've been nice to have round nose pliers to make cleaner swirls on the back. All lessons for future pieces.

After finishing, I lay the pendant in the cute purple box that once delivered my girlfriend's jewelry to me. I turned it into a brown paper package tied up with string, one of my favorite things, and finished it off with a wax seal a la [Rajiv Surendra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3dR4jhImU).
