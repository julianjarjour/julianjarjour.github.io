<div class="context">I wrote this essay for my first semester English course. If you're not familiar with Tony Kushner's play <em>Angels in America</em>, maybe the scene described in the first paragraph will inspire you to check it out.</div>

<span class="dc">T</span>he delusional, Valium-addicted Mormon, Harper Pitt, upon discovering
that her sexually unsatisfying husband Joe had always secretly longed for a
phallus, finds herself rejoicing in the middle of an Antarctic flurry. In the
“cold shelter for the shattered,” betwixt mountains of ice and below an
intact ozone layer, she makes a snow angel and speaks with a Mr. Lies who
lives in her mind. No longer tethered by a deteriorating marriage, her
visionary nature brought to Antarctica: trees, caribou, and an Eskimo who
might actually love her. Breast milk became hot cocoa while a marsupial
kicked in her womb.

All the while, the nagging Mr. Lies tries to remind her that “ice has a way of
melting.” This ridiculousness is only a Valium-enhanced version of the
delusions that we all put ourselves through, and the beliefs that have
captured our undeserved faith. In times of turmoil—times marked by
AIDS and tranquilizers and slug-bitten love, war(s) and dictatorship(s)
and glyphosate mist—we all long for an escape. When we make it to
Antarctica or Tibet or Mars, not even the tinnitic truth that rings from the
subconscious can peel us away.

Aside from Harper’s romantic troubles, we know that the natural
environment is another one of her concerns. Following the Rabbi-taught
blowjob lesson on the radio, she learned about “holes in the ozone layer.
Over Antarctica. Skin burns, birds go blind, icebergs melt. The world’s
coming to an end.” These very real issues serve her as external
confirmation of her internal feelings of devastation, of doomsday. This
idea of the world falling apart is echoed throughout the play, with Harper’s
“The world. Finite. Terribly, terribly,” Ethel Rosenberg’s “History is about
to crack wide open. Millennium approaches,” and Prior Walter’s 17th
preceding ancestor—including the bastards—’s “The 20th century. Oh,
dear, the world has gotten so terribly, terribly old.” Thus, her Antarctica is
of a prehistoric era; pristine, open to interpretation, and conspicuously
featuring ozone. In this scene, the world’s not ending. It’s a gay fantasia.

It’s a blue world, numbingly cold. “No sorrow here, tears freeze,” says Mr.
Lies. She never wants to leave, believing, like a cryonicist, that a heart
frozen cannot die. Likewise, a person who is constantly connected cannot
think. Rather than hear the dissonance of the outside world, we put our
earbuds in and move on, forgetting the birds. Rather than face our
hardships (or god forbid, human conversation), we scroll and scroll until
the last trace of our humanity is erased. Rather than form our own opinions,
we first ask our favorite celebrities what to think and we have AI write our
dissertations. These are all forms of escapism, but they don’t make our
problems go away, just as a frozen corpse won’t be brought back to life in
the years to come. They are also all indicators of a growing loneliness
epidemic and soaring depression rates in youth. Life lived in delusion can’t
be rewarding, at least not in any true sense.

But the truth still nags, even in ours and Harper’s delusions. “No timber
here,” says Mr. Lies. “There are no Eskimo in Antarctica, and you’re not
really pregnant,” he asserts. Harper shoos that voice away and wills a
“fisher of the polar deep” into existence, choosing to live in blissful
artificial ignorance. When we shoo away our subconscious, it grows
weaker, limply protesting “there’s something wrong with this picture.” Artificial
ignorance isn’t always our own creation. Harper’s addiction is owed to the
fact that Valium was the most prescribed drug in the country at that time,
and it has always benefited the rich and powerful for the masses to be
sedated. Today, social media feeds into a lucrative personal data market,
and its engineers are doing their best to hold your attention for as long as
possible. For our attentions and attention-spans to be intentionally taken
away against our own will is the most frightening overreach of
corporate and government power.

While you still can, listen to your subconscious. “Respect the delicate
ecology of your delusions.” Listen to Mr. Lies, because he speaks the truth.
Unfortunately, Harper Pitt decided to say “fuck the truth,” and—well, you
know the rest.
