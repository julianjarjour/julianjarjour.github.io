<span class="dc">T</span>oday, I went for a walk with my camera. It's been a while since I last took photos for myself, and I figured walking would be a step toward some desperately needed spiritual healing.

My dad thrifted this particular DSLR for $15 from Savers, nice bag included, probably a year ago at this point. I'm currently lending out my main camera, so I was lucky to have this one laying around.

So I left my house with no phone or watch, and took a very relaxing stroll through the park and the cemetery. About 20 shots in, the reflex mirror behind the lens came loose, and I was somehow oblivious to the void overtaking the viewfinder.

I managed to get a dozen more shots in before the mirror was completely out of place and the viewfinder totally dark. By that time, I figured out the issue. If I really wanted to, I could've kept jostling the mirror back into place after every shot, but that was getting to be ridiculous.

This didn't particularly bother me until I got home and reviewed my photos. I didn't like any of them. Weird how a peaceful walk can end in disappointment, but alas. I just moved on to other things. That is, until I looked again.

Amidst all of my mediocre unobstructed photos were these two. A third of the composition swallowed by darkness. Something about that captivated me, and I would go as far as to call these photos my only successes of the day. Not in spite of the mirror falling out, but *because* of it.

So, if something is getting in the way of your endeavors, perhaps you can try to find a way to incorporate it. Appreciate those setbacks in your life, because you might learn from them, and maybe you'll even get something beautiful out of them.
