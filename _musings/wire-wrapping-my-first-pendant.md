Recently, I surprised my friend with a pendant that I wire-wrapped for her birthday. She makes lovely jewelry herself, and I'm lucky to have received many pieces from her in the past. I secretly developed an interest in the craft and decided to make *her* something for a change.

I always thought that I wasn't much of a gifter, but through crafting this from the choice of stone to the wax seal stamp I realized, joyfully, how wrong I was. Here's a bit of my process.

First, I ordered the choicest bloodstone cabochon (a shaped and polished stone) off of Etsy. Bloodstone is one of the March birthstones, along with aquamarine. It does irk me a bit that modern birthstone classifications are just a marketing tactic to sell more of certain gems. I wish I could find a reliable (non-jeweler) source on their historical/folkloric bases, but bloodstone is beautiful nonetheless. I also ordered a 5mm faceted (cut) citrine gem to match the hints of yellow in the bloodstone. 

Then I bought the last remaining coils of 20g and 26g copper wire from Michaels' ransacked shelves, raided my dad's basement workshop for some wire cutters and pliers, and got to work on [a great tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLAEE0fHpE){:target="_blank"} from Ellie's Handcrafted Jewelry.

In the beginning I struggled to get my base wires straight and couldn't keep Goldilocks tension on the weaving wire, but my technique slowly improved---the weaves on the back are far cleaner than those on the front, pictured below.

I don't think the wires I bought were quite "dead-soft," as is recommended, which may have made things more difficult. The gauges were too similar which made the piece a little clunky. It also would've been nice to have round-nose pliers to make cleaner swirls on the back. All lessons for future pieces.

That being said, for my first time, I was very happy with the result. After finishing, I laid the pendant in a cute purple wooden box that once carried me a handmade piece of her own. I wrapped it in a way that would please Julie Andrews, and finished it off with a wax seal a la [Rajiv Surendra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm3dR4jhImU){:target="_blank"}. And, she loved it.
